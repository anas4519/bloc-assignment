# bloc_assignment

A Flutter project demonstrating state management using BLoC pattern.

## Project Overview

This application showcases the implementation of BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern in Flutter. It manages state effectively by separating the business logic from the UI components.

## Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture approach with the following layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI components (widgets) and BLoC implementations
- **Domain Layer**: Houses the business logic and use cases
- **Data Layer**: Manages data operations and external services

The BLoC pattern implementation ensures:
- Unidirectional data flow
- Separation of concerns
- Testable components
- Scalable architecture
